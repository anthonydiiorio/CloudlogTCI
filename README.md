# CloudlogTCI ðŸ“»
TCI bridge for [Cloudlog](https://github.com/magicbug/Cloudlog), an excellent web based logging software for amateur radio.

TCI is a modern alternative to serial based rig control by [Expert Electronics](https://eesdr.com/en/), based on WebSockets. 

CloudlogTCI allows you to connect your SunSDR to Cloudlog with the TCI protocol.

Both VFOs will be now available under the Station/Radio dropdown and the Hardware Interfaces page.

### Bandmap üó∫Ô∏è

New! If you want to use the Bandmap feature in Wavelog set `bandmap: true` in the config file. To control RX2 from Wavelog, set the port to 54322 in the Hardware Interfaces settings. Click on the callsign in the bandmap to tune the radio.
